Heap-Of-Fun
===========
To Run
You must install rspec:

`gem install rspec`

To run your tests put heaps_spec and your code file in the same directory and:

`rspec heaps_spec.rb myHeapsClasses.rb`

## Notes
This spec only tests the method interface, you must either add specs to test functionality, or ensure your code works in some other way.
__Passing tests != 100%__
